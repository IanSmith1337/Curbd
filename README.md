Donâ€™t ditch it. Curb it.

# The problem:
At the end of every academic semester, at college dorms across the nation, an event of massive proportions begins. The name of this event? Move out. Figuring out how you'll get home with whatever stuff you bought while on campus is one of the greatest hurdles to overcome. Because of the limited space in most modes of transport, a lot of items that are just slightly used end up in a landfill. 

# The solution
Curbd combats this problem by allowing students to pass on the items that they are unable to take with them to other students who can, saving these items from ending up in the trash.
